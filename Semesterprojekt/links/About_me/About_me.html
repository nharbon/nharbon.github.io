    <h1>MY HOBBYS</h1>
    <h3>SCOOTER</h3>    
    <p>I have alot of hobbys but my favourite is definitely riding my scooter with friends. I have been riding my Scooter for 3-4 years now and have learned alot.
    I also had alot of small injuries and some up and downs. But everytime I go out and ride my Scooter I feel free and it makes a lot of fun. I also met some of my best friends through scootering.</p>

    <h3>PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>   
    <p>My second favourite hobby is Photography. I like beeing out with friends and taking pictures. I have got the Canon 60D, which is a pretty old camera but it has got a good quality for pictures. I mostly use the Sigma 18mm-35mm f1.8 because it´s good for low light. I also have the 50mm f1.4 and the 10mm-22mm f3.5 but I don´t use them that much. </p>
